Maven:(Project Object Model)
-----
 * It is a Java based S/w project management and comprehension tool.It can manage project's build, reporting and documentation.
 * Maven increases reusability.
 
Build Process:
-------------
 * It is a process that covers all the steps 
        - Generate Source.
        - Compiling a source
		- Executing test(UNIT and Integration  Test)
		- Packaging (Jar, war and ear)
		- Runining health checks
		- Generating reports
A build process alone will speed the migration of software from one environment to another.

Compiling & Execution:
---------------------
     This are two steps processes.
	       - During compilation phase Java compiler compiles the source code.(.class file)
		   - JVM takes the .class as input and generate output by executing the bytecode.

Installation:
-------------
        - Install Java
		- Download the maven (wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.5.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.tar.gz
		- Extract the file & rename file "apache-maven" and copy to /usr/local/src/
		- Export the paths: "#export M2_HOME=/usr/local/src/apache-maven"
		                    "#export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
		- mvn --version
